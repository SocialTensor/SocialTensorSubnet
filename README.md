# 🎨 NicheImage - Decentralized Image Generation Network 🌐

## Introduction

### Description
NicheImage is a decentralized network that utilizes the Bittensor protocol to enable distributed image generation. This document serves as a guide for setting up and participating in the network, targeting both validators and miners. It includes essential information on project setup, operation, and contribution.

### Key Features
- 🚀 **Decentralized Image Generation Network**: Incentivizing miners to scale up their computational resources, allowing for up to thousands of generations per minute with sufficient GPU resources.
- 📈 **Volume Commitment**: Miners commit to a model type and generation volume.
- 💰 **Incentivized Volume Rewarding Mechanism**: 
  - `new_reward = (matching_result - time_penalty) * (0.6 + 0.4 * volume_scale)`
  - `matching_result` is 0 or 1 based on the similarity matching result with the reproduction of the validator.
  - `time_penalty = 0.4 * (processing_time / timeout)**3`
  - `volume_scale = max(min(total_volume**0.5 / 1000**0.5, 1), 0)`
- 🌟 **Continuous Improvement**: Introducing new models and features based on usage demand.
- 💵 **Earn as a Validator**: Validators can earn money by sharing their request capacity with miners.

## Setup and Participation

**These guide use `pm2` as a process manager**. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by following the instructions below:
- Install NodeJS Package Manager (npm) [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Install pm2: `npm i pm2 -g`

### For Validators
1. 🛠️ Install the required dependencies and set up the NicheImage validator node.
2. ⚙️ Configure the validator settings, including the amount of TAO to stake.
3. 🚀 Start the validator node and begin processing image generation requests from miners.

Detailed instructions on setting up the NicheImage validator node can be found [here](instructions/validator.md).

### For Miners
1. 🛠️ Install the necessary dependencies and set up the NicheImage miner node.
2. 🗂️ Choose the desired model type and specify the generation volume.
3. 🚀 Start the miner node and begin contributing computational resources to the network.

Detailed instructions on setting up the NicheImage miner node can be found [here](instructions/miner.md).
